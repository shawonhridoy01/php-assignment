//  Case Study:

// I have three old hp monitors, not new. I want to sell it on my own website. That’s why I should create a product upload form on my website, then upload my product with specification and available quantity. My monitors have a 15.6 inch display. My monitor’s VGA cable status, yes, I will sell it for 8000 tk.

// For creating a product upload form what specifications will be uploaded and what will be their data types?


$monitor_brand="hp"; //data type string
$monitor_condition= "used"; //data type string
$monitor_quantity= 3; //data type decimal
$monitor_display_size=15.6; //data type float/double
$is_vga_included = true; //data type boolean
$price_of_price=8000;  // data type decimal
